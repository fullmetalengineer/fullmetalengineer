### Hello! 👋

I'm Alan. I focus on building software projects for startups. My default software stack is a Rails backend and an Angular|Vue (prefer Nuxt) front-end, but each project is unique and that stack changes depending on the project requirements.

- 📍 I live in the American Heartland. I grew up here in Flyover country, and I'll likely die here.
- 💻 I’m currently working on: Tons of client work. Soon on my own projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning woodturning, the Elixir language, and the Phoenix framework for it.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at alan.d.long@protonmail.com, or reach out on Twitter at [@TacticalMinivan](https://twitter.com/TacticalMinivan)
