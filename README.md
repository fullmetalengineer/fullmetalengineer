### Hello! 👋

I focus on building software projects for startups. My default software stack is a Rails backend and an Next.js front-end, but each project is unique and that stack changes depending on the project requirements. I've used Rails, Elixir, Golang, C#/DotNet, and C++ (many years ago!)

- 📍 I live in the American Heartland. I grew up here in Flyover country, and I love it here.
- 💻 I’m currently working on: Tons of client work. Soon on my own projects!
- 🌱 On the fun side, I’m currently learning 3D printing!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at alan.d.long@protonmail.com!
