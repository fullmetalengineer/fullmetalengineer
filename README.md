### Hello! 👋

I'm Alan. I focus on building software projects for startups. My default software stack is a Rails backend and an Angular|React front-end, but each project is unique and that stack changes depending on the project requirements.

- 📍 I live in the American Heartland. I grew up here in Flyover country, and I'll likely die here.
- 💻 I’m currently working on a Direct-to-Consumer Agriculture Platform to make it easier for farmers to sell directly to customers, and easier for customers to discover and buy directly from local farmers. I am very big into localism!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning woodturning, the Elixir language, and the Phoenix framework for it.
